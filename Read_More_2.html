1. Divided sentences into terms, analyzed terms properties and syntactic dependency by LTP-Cloud with Java.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">2. Learned word vectors by word2vec for croups</p>
<p style="text-align: left">3. Extracted words features like nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs, and extracted sentences structurefeatures like ATT, ADV and so on with python. Processed these features considering the word no.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">4. Represented corpus by matching word vectors with features, and trained the labeled vector document by SVM Perf to separately do predictions for words features and sentences structure features.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">5. Combined the predictions of words features and that of sentences structure features together by learning weight and threshold, which improved accuracy about 15% for only training words features</p>
