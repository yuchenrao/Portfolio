<p style="text-align: left">Won the third prize of Freescale Cup: Intelligent Car Racing(electromagnetism group) of North China region</p>
<p style="text-align: left">1.Mathematical Research:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
1).Individually improved adaptive PID algorithm with adaptive coefficient to 1m/s, which worked well to maintain the velocity steadily.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">2).Individually improved adaptive PD algorithm by: i) dividing the control condition into 8 sections for right and left turns with independent threshold based on the value captured by sensors; ii) introducing 16 different adaptive coefficients to those 16 sections. The algorithm worked well to improve the stability and accuracy of turning angle of steering engine.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
3).Promoted a more stable and accurate controlling method of the intelligent car by : i). used filter function to capture 30 value groups by sensors ; ii). used Matlab to fit a function with these value, concluded the regulation of value and relative distance deviation ; iii). used fuzzy control theory to separate 16 segments with adaptive coefficients to control deflection angle of steering engine.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
2.Hands-on Work:</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
1).Distributed tasks for other 3 team members and scheduled the whole process of this program with limited time.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
2).Coded the main controlling program on controlling the intelligent car (mainly about motor and steering engine) in different situations like straightaway, curve and cross track guided by electrical wires at the CodeWarrior of XS128 platform.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
3).Individually solved technical problems rapidly and accurately, like the sudden stop of motor, the oscillationof the reed switch and the absent measured value of encoder</p>
